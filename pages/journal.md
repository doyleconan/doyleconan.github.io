A simple, inaccurate tracking of review time for major journals. 
The tracking is mainly based on my own submissions and reviews. The number are averaged based on a rather small set of measurements thus the variance would be rather large.
But this post is mainly point out the fact that the full review cycle is much longer than the time allocated for the reviewers to write their reviews. There are a lot of extra time such as, inviting the review (this may takes several weeks), the reviewer may not submit their review in-time (several weeks delay is possible); after all the reviews are collected, there will be area editor input recommendation (several weeks) and some journal also need one extra editor-in-chief's final recommendation. 

As you can see from the table, top computer graphics journals usually takes 2-4 months for one round of review. That partially explains why people prefer submitting their works in conferences for faster turn around. 

| Journal | Review Period | Actual Review Round |
| TVCG		| 28 days | 70 days |
| TOG		| 30 days | 120 days |
